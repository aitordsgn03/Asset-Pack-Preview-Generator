# 3D Asset Pack Preview Generator

## About the Project

<div align="center">

This project was created inspired by the amazing work of [@Kenney](https://kenney.nl/). The source code  of the pages and the style of them are his [work](https://github.com/KenneyNL?tab=repositories). I didn't want to take credits of work that wasn't mine. If you want to support amazing free asset development go [check his work](https://kenney.nl/assets) or [donate him](https://kenney.nl/donate). 

The **3D Asset Pack Preview Generator** is inspired by the workflow of creating well-organized and visually appealing asset packs for game development and 3D design. The goal is to make it easier for creators to present their work efficiently, with minimal manual effort.

This tool has been developed to speed up and enhance the creation of 3D asset packs. The tool is meant for generating previews for each 3D model that you have in your asset pack and create a `.json` file. With those previews and the `.json` files, Astro will be used to create an `index.html` page to preview the details and the information of the asset pack.

This repository contains two interconnected tools for managing 3D asset packs:

1. **Godot Tool**: A standalone application that generates previews of 3D models and creates a `.json` file with all the necessary metadata for an asset pack. This tool integrates seamlessly with the **Astro Webpage Generator** by providing the required previews and metadata, which are then used to build a professional and visually appealing webpage for showcasing the asset pack.
2. **Astro Webpage Generator**: A static site generator built with Astro that uses the previews and metadata from the Godot tool to create an attractive webpage for showcasing the asset pack.

Both tools are lightweight and require only **Godot** and **Astro** to work.

## Features

### Godot Tool

- Render previews of 3D models.
- Automatically generate a `.json` file containing:
  - Model details (e.g., vertex count, author, license).
  - Preview image paths.
  - Customizable metadata (editable outside the Godot editor).
- Modular functionality to enable or disable specific features.

**Availability**:

- [Download on GitHub](https://github.com/aitordsgn03/Asset-Pack-Preview-Generator/releases)
- [Available on the Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset)

---

### Astro Webpage Generator

- Transform the `.json` file and previews generated by the Godot tool into a clean, professional webpage.
- Fully static and highly customizable.
- Supports filtering and searching through asset pack contents.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Godot 4.x**: Download it from [godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org/).
- **Astro**: Ensure you have `pnpm` installed. You can install it from [pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io/). Then, install Astro using:

  ```sh
  pnpm install astro
  ```

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aitordsgn03/Asset-Pack-Preview-Generator.git
```

---

### Using the Godot Tool

1. **Open the Godot project**:
   - Launch Godot 4.x.
   - Open the `godot-tool/` directory.

2. **Load 3D Models**:
   - Drag and drop your `.glb`, `.obj`, or other supported formats into the tool. Place these models in the "models" folder.
   - ![Screenshot of loading 3D models](path/to/screenshot.png)

3. **Render Previews**:
   - Adjust the camera or lighting if needed.
   - By clicking in the `Main Controller` element you will be able to select the resolution, padding, and output directory of the images.
   - ![Screenshot of rendering previews](path/to/screenshot.png)

4. **Generate Metadata**:
   - Click the `Metadata Generator`.
   - Fill out details such as author, license, version, website, and description.

### Generating the Webpage

1. **Navigate to the `astro-web/` directory**:
   ```sh
   cd astro-web/
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Add Previews and Metadata**:
   - Place `.png` preview images in `src/assets/images/`.
   - Place the `.json` metadata file in `src/data/`.

4. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```sh
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   This command will start a local server for previewing your webpage.

5. **Build the Static Site**:
   Once you‚Äôre happy with your webpage:
   ```sh
   pnpm run build
   ```

   The output will be in the `dist/` directory.

6. **Deploy the Site**:
   Upload the contents of the `dist/` folder to your hosting provider, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
